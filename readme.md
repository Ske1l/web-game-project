<!-- this was for a milestone project in class. i'm not a very inspired person, so i couldn't think of anything original. I just went with trying to make something similar (albeit, far from perfect) to the google dinosaur game  -->

<!-- i couldn't get my assets to work (just displayed broken images) so i linked free use/fair use images in the html -->


<!-- controls just Left Click to jump. that's it. Just reset the page on game over to go again
 -->


 <!-- let characterTop =
        parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(character).getPropertyValue("top"))
    let objectLeft =
        parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(obstacle).getPropertyValue("left"));
    if (objectLeft < 30 && objectLeft > 0 && characterTop >= 410)
    
    this set of code i had to google for hours since i didn't know how to do collision. in my rush and panic trying to complete this project, i neglected to save the exact post. will update if found again  -->
